	<h1> iFrame Demonstration </h1>

	<h3> Definition and Usage </h3>

	<p> 
		The iframe tag specifies and inline frame. An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document. <br>(source: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_iframe.asp) 
	</p>

	<p>
		Common applications of iframes include the embeding of multimedia, such as a YouTube video, into a site which dosn't host the content itself.
	</p>
		<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" width="420px" height="315">
		  <p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p>
		</iframe>
	<p>
		Note how YouTubes video player is used to present the video. Iframes enable for not only the borrowing of content but also the means of which it is displayed.  
	</p>

	<p> 
		Essentially, I frames enable us to display one website within another. An example of this application of iframes can be seen below. 
	</p>

		<iframe src="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_iframe" width="420px" height="420px"></iframe>

	<p> 
		Iframes were born out of the age of frame bassed layouts. Frame Layouts were used to seperate content into different windows and reduce loading times by allowing for the issolated loading of certain content and reuse of static content. As the internet sped up, iframes maintained apeal by allowing for the ebedment of foreign content. The attributes of iframes, such as size, visibility, scrolling, in combination with styling allowed for the customization of displayed content.  
	</p>

	<p>
		The width and height attributes of the following iframe are set to 1000x600 pixels while the src is set to the path of the content, in this case a pdf, being displayed. Since iframe is a relic of the early internet, mainy of its attributes can be defined by using either the HTLM within the tag or CSS with src being an exception.
